    <h1>SMS Spam Classifier</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a SMS spam classifier using Multinomial Naive Bayes. The classifier achieves an accuracy of 95% and a precision of 1.0, making it highly effective in distinguishing between spam and non-spam (ham) messages.</p>
    <h2>Contents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>sms_spam_classifier.ipynb</strong>: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the SMS spam classifier. The notebook is well-documented and includes explanations for each step of the implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Dependencies</h2>
    <p>Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:</p>
    <pre>
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
    </pre>
    <h2>Usage</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Clone the repository to your local machine:</li>
        <pre>
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sms-spam-classifier.git
        </pre>
        <li>Navigate to the project directory:</li>
        <pre>
cd sms-spam-classifier
        </pre>
        <li>Open and run the Jupyter notebook <strong>sms_spam_classifier.ipynb</strong> using Jupyter or any compatible notebook environment.</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and evaluate the SMS spam classifier.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Dataset</h2>
    <p>The notebook uses a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham. The dataset used for training and testing the classifier can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The SMS spam classifier achieves the following performance metrics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Accuracy: 95%</li>
        <li>Precision: 1.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm in classifying SMS messages as spam or ham.</p>
